[jQuery Tools](http://flowplayer.org/tools/) - The Missing UI library for the Web
================================

Please, pay attention:

- This is a fork to keep the code shared and free
- The original repository didn't show a whole js file with (almost) all the jquerytools features in. Here you can find it.
- It seems needing some libraries, mainly jquery: the jquerytools source needs the Jquery.browser property, removed since jquery 1.9.
Using the 1.8.3 it seems working quite fine. Here you can find it.

jQuery Tools is a collection of the most important user-interface components for modern websites. Used by large sites all over the world.

##Contributing

Please issue pull requests to the [dev branch](https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/tree/dev).  

This is where active development takes place, we then merge changes into master for releases. That will become v1.2.6. 
Most of the development goes to 2.0 which is currently a private repository.
